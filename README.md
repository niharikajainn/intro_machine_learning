Implementation of a plain-vanilla feed-forward neural network to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This code was written to be presented at the workshop I hosted ("Microsoft at ASU: Intro to Machine Learning with Tensorflow") in April 2018 as a Microsoft Student Partner for ASU.
